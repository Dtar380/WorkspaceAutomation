## :memo: Working on
Currently working on the first release for the application (0.1.0 following the convention of Mayor.Minor.Patch)

### Already planned releases

| VERSION | INCLUDES                    |
|---------|-----------------------------|
|  0.1.0  | First Release               |
|  0.2.0  | Code review and refactoring |
|  1.0.0  | Final application           |

### On consideration
Right now we have three main things in consideration for future updates for this Application, which are:

- **GitLab** support
- **More editors** support (like JetBrains IDE's and VisualStudio)
- **Custom .gitignore** adding all folders and files that are not usually wanted in your Repo's like tests or editor configurations.

Feel free to open Feature Requests [issues](https://github.com/Dtar380/WorkspaceAutomation/issues/new/choose) to request things related to this concepts such popular IDE's, popular Git services with REST API's (API needed for being able to give support), unwanted types of files and folders generated by WorkSpace creations, etc.

## :open_file_folder: Known Issues
Right now we are storing the API KEY on plain text, we will update that before first release for security reasons. This will make users need to type a password when using the App, but its preferable to make it harder but safer than easier to use but much more risky.
