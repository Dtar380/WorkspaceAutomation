## :arrow_down: App Installation

### Using built application (Not aviable now)
You can download the installer for your Operating System in the releases tab.<br>
It's preferable to download the latest version always for many reasons. Download it [here](https://github.com/Dtar380/WorkspaceAutomation/releases/latest).

### Using it as a Python Package
If you're a python enjoyer ðŸ—¿ you can install it with pip from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/WorkspaceAutomation) to your main python installation so you can use it automatically from the terminal.

For doing this, just open a terminal and run:
`pip install WorkspaceAutomation`

### Building the python package yourself
You can always download the source version either from latest release and build it yourself.
To do so follow the next steps:

<details>
<summary>Download the Repo</summary>

- First go to the latest release on the releases page
- Scroll to the bottom and download the source.zip file
- Unzip the file where you desire

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install the dependencies</summary>

- Now make sure you're running on python 3.12.4 (run `python --version`)
- Now run `python -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install app via pip</summary>

- Now run `python -m pip install -e .`
- Your CLI app is now working and you can call it via command line whenever you want

</details>

### Already planned releases

### On consideration
Right now we have three main things in consideration for future updates for this Application, which are:

- **URL/APP** saving on the go, making it easier to manage your workspaces
- **GitLab** support
- **More editors** support (like JetBrains IDE's and VisualStudio)
- **Custom .gitignore** adding all folders and files that are not usually wanted in your Repo's like tests or editor configurations.
- **Notion** support
- **Multilingual** support (May make the project collaborative)

Feel free to open Feature Requests [issues](https://github.com/Dtar380/WorkspaceAutomation/issues/new/choose) to request things related to this concepts such popular IDE's, popular Git services with REST API's (API needed for being able to give support), unwanted types of files and folders generated by WorkSpace creations, etc.

## :open_file_folder: Known Issues
The `-y, --yes` flag is not working, I know that and I am going to bring a fix soon this week.
We are knowledgeable that theres no way to update and uninstall the program via CLI itself if its not installed as a python module, this is not an error, it's jut not implemented yet.
