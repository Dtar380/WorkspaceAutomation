# WorkSpace Automation
---

**Workspace Automation** is a CLI tool designed for developers to **simplify and automate** the process of setting up and using development **WorkSpaces**. With this program you can manage anything you can imagine that could be related to a WorkSpace, _as long as it has an API_.
<br>
<br>

## What is a WorkSpace?
---
A **WorkSpace** is just the place where you can find all your **tools** that you use for your particular job, which in our case as developers this is our **projects**. Normally you will have everything dispersed through out your system and even the internet, but with this tool you can have **everything in one place** and open and use all your tools with **one command**.
<br>

This app manages **WorkSpaces** as a dictionary which contains values such as the name of the project, the local directory, the programming language used, repository data if provided such as name, owner, license, language, and on top of that it also contains the apps you use for your project (your tools) and the Urls you open when coding on your project.
<br>
<br>


## Why should you use it?
---
Im 99% certain that **WorkSpace Automation** has the ability to increase every developer productivity, because it will reduce the time consumed by activities that are not related to creating code.
<br>

In the end thats why **WorkSpace Automation** was made, to make developers waste less time by automating tasks such as creating and managing their projects or setting up a working space everytime they got to work on a project, which are boring, repetitive, and therefore a waste of time doing it manually.
<br>

And I know theres this phrase which goes like _"Why do manual boring tasks when you can just waste more time failing to automate them"_, but thats why I did this piece of software, so you can just skip the part of wasting time and failing and I will do it for you, to make you a more productive developer.
