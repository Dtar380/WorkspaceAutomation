# WorkSpace Manager
---
This is the main feature of this project and was the reason I decided to make it. This feature is everything related with the files of a WorkSpace, creating them, managing them.

## Creation
---
You can create a WorkSpace from the beginning with this CLI APP, this will create all files and directories related to the language selected, a virtual environment if necessary, and the dictionary inside the WorkSpaces.json to store all the WorkSpace information.

## Importing
---
You can also import a project as a workspace as long as it already exists and is located in your computer. This will be as creating a WorkSpace but skipping the part of creating the files, folders and virtual environment.

## Relocating
---
You can relocate any WorkSpace you have created or imported to another location inside your computer at any time you want.
